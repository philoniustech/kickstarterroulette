# Tom & Ben's Kickstarter Roulette üé≤üîç

Welcome to the **Kickstarter Roulette** app! If you're a fan of the Yogscast's Tom & Ben, you must be familiar with their weekly Warhammer stream. Let's build them a fun, interactive web app to help them play Kickstarter Roulette with chat!

I, Philonius, plan on managing the repo and the MRs to start, and will be providing the project any necessary resources such as servers, etc. The domain kickstarterroulette.com is already purchased and I will be deploying the app to a server and making it live for Tom & Ben once it's ready!

## About Kickstarter Roulette

- **What's the Deal?** Every week, Tom and Ben dive into the wild world of Kickstarter campaigns. They'll handpick a few projects. They'll ask chat to pick a project or two. And then they are all judged against each other, with the coolest winning! One caveat, however, don't be horny! Too much horniness is terms for disqualification.

- **Why the app?** I wanted to complete a few goals.

    1. Getting my feet wet with running an open-source project
    2. Giving Tom, Ben, and chat a fun way to play Kickstarter Roulette
    3. Practice my own Angular skills, which are very new
    4. Learn from and with the community! Many of them being much better developers than I, without a doubt.

## Getting Started with Development

1. **Clone the Repository**: First things first! Clone this repo to your local machine. You can use your favorite Git client or simply run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/philoniustech/kickstarterroulette.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Feature Branches FTW**: We're all about collaboration! When working on a new feature or fixing a bug, create a descriptive feature branch. Please name the branch based on the id of the correlating Github Issue, preceded by "issue-". If no issue exists for something you want to work on, just create it! For example:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b issue-1
    ```

4. **Code Like a Pro**: Write clean, elegant code. And no judgment! We're all learning together and improving together.

5. **Submit a Merge Request**: Once your feature is complete, submit a merge request (MR). If approved, we'll merge it into the main branch.
